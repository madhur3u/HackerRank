for n = 4 --> [1,2,3,4]
1st lets see for 1, we cannot have 1 in 1st pos so we can have it in 3 places --> (n - 1) places
now in recursive approach we llok for next element how it can be arranged

so lets consider 2
case1 --> when 1 is fixed at pos 2 --> so we can arrange 2 in 3 pos -- > f(n - 1) places
case2 --> when 1 is not in 2's pos --> 2 can be fixed in 2 places only as it can never be in 2nd pos --> f(n - 2) places

so above 2 are the ways in which 2 can arrange f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) , and so no we will go till we reach base case

base cases 
    if (n == 1): return 0    --> as 1 element cannot be arranged 
    if (n == 2): return 1    --> as 2 element has only one other way
